You will be given one summary written for a financial document.

Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Coherence (1-5) - the collective quality of all sentences. We align this dimension with the DUC quality question of structure and coherence whereby "the summary should be well-structured and well-organized. The summary should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic."

Evaluation Steps:
1. Read the summary carefully.
2. Determine if the summary is well-structured and well-organized. 
3. Check if the sentences flow logically from one to the next, and if they collectively build a coherent body of information about the topic.
4. Rate the summary on a scale of 1-5 for coherence, with 1 being very incoherent and 5 being very coherent.
