You will be given a financial document. You will then be given one summary written for this financial document.

Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:

Consistency (1-5) - the factual alignment between the summary and the summarized source. A factually consistent summary contains only statements that are entailed by the source document. Annotators were also asked to penalize summaries that contained hallucinated facts. 

Evaluation Steps:
1. Read the financial document carefully and understand the key points and facts presented.
2. Read the summary and compare it with the information in the financial document.
3. Evaluate the summary based on the consistency of the facts presented in the summary with those in the financial document.
4. Rate the summary on a scale of 1-5, where 1 means the summary is not consistent at all with the financial document and 5 means the summary is completely consistent with the financial document.
5. If the summary contains hallucinated facts, i.e., facts not present in the financial document, penalize the summary by giving it a lower score.
